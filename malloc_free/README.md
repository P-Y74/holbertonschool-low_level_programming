# C - malloc, free

## üìå Introduction
This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. You will learn the basics of dynamic memory management, how to allocate memory during runtime, and how to free memory when it's no longer needed.

---

## üìö Resources
To successfully complete this project, make sure to read or watch the following materials:

- [0x0a - malloc & free - quick overview.pdf](https://intranet.holbertonschool.com)
- [Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free (stop at 6:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjVFb2ftA_M)

**man** or **help**:
  - `malloc`
  - `free`

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- ‚úÖ The difference between **automatic** and **dynamic** memory allocation.
- ‚úÖ How to use `malloc` and `free` for dynamic memory management.
- ‚úÖ When and why you should use **malloc**.
- ‚úÖ How to use **valgrind** to check for memory leaks.

## üìã Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Compilation on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **Betty style**. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use **global variables**.
- No more than **5 functions per file**.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`. You don‚Äôt have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it, it won‚Äôt be taken into account.
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don‚Äôt have to push them to your repo (if you do, we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don‚Äôt forget to push your **header file**.

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0-create_array.c` | **Creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific character.**                           |
