# C - Recursion

## üìå Introduction
This project focuses on **recursion** in C, where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems. Recursion is a useful technique, but it requires a solid understanding to avoid issues like infinite loops or excessive memory usage.

## üìö Resources
To successfully complete this project, make sure to read and watch the following materials:

- Recursion, introduction (Holberton School property)
- [What on Earth is Recursion?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc)
- [C - Recursion](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_recursion.htm)
- [C Programming Tutorial 85, Recursion pt.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGxbXMP6k8k)
- [C Programming Tutorial 86, Recursion pt.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XiIS6HobNs)

## üéØ Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- ‚úÖ What **recursion** is and how to implement it.
- ‚úÖ In what situations **recursion** should be used.
- ‚úÖ In what situations **recursion** should not be used.

---

## üìã Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- - Compilation on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **Betty style**. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use **global variables**.
- No more than **5 functions per file**.
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use **_putchar**.
  - You don‚Äôt have to push `_putchar.c`; we will use our file. If you do, it won‚Äôt be taken into account.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don‚Äôt forget to push your **header file**.
- You are not allowed to use any kind of **loops**.
- You are not allowed to use **static variables**.
