# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## 📌 Introduction
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- **Pointers and arrays** (Holberton School property)
- **Data Structures** (Holberton School property)

---

## 📚 Resources
To successfully complete this project, make sure to read and watch the following materials:

- [C - Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm)
- [C - Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)
- [C - Strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm)
- [Memory Layout](https://aticleworld.com/memory-layout-of-c-program/)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- ✅ What **pointers** are and how to use them.  
- ✅ What **arrays** are and how to use them.  
- ✅ The differences between **pointers** and **arrays**.  
- ✅ How to use **strings** and how to manipulate them.  
- ✅ The **scope of variables** in C.

## 📋 Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **Betty style**. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are **not allowed to use global variables**.
- No more than **5 functions per file**.
- You are **not allowed to use the standard library**. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
  - You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`; we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account.
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you **don’t have to push them** to your repo (if you do, we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files during compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don’t forget to push your **header file**.

### More Info

You do not need to learn about **pointers to functions**, **pointers to pointers**, **multidimensional arrays**, **arrays of structures**, **malloc**, and **free** - yet.
