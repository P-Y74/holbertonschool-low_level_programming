## ⚙️ How to Use This Repository
Each directory contains:
✅ **C source files** implementing different concepts.
✅ **Header files (`.h`)** defining function prototypes.
✅ **Readme files** explaining the purpose of each project.
✅ **Compilation instructions and test cases**.

### 🖥️ Compilation
All C programs should be compiled with `gcc` using the following flags:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file.c> -o <output>
```

### 📏 Coding Style
All code follows the **Betty Coding Style**, ensuring readability and consistency.
