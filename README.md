# holbertonschool-low_level_programming

## Introduction
Welcome to the **holbertonschool-low_level_programming** repository! This repository contains all the foundational projects related to low-level programming in C as part of the first-year curriculum at **Holberton School**. Each directory corresponds to a specific concept in C programming, covering everything from basic syntax to more advanced topics like data structures, memory management, and system programming.

## Concepts Overview
### C - Hello, World
Introduction to the C programming language, including basic syntax, the compilation process, and the `printf` function.

### C - Variables, if, else, while
Understanding variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and loops (`while`).

### C - Functions, nested loops
Creating and using functions, understanding scope, and working with nested loops.

### C - More functions, more nested loops
Advanced function usage and deeper exploration of loop nesting.

### C - Pointers, arrays and strings
Introduction to pointers, arrays, and string manipulation.

### C - More pointers, arrays and strings
Advanced pointer arithmetic, multidimensional arrays, and memory handling.

### C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
Complex applications of pointers and memory management.

### C - Recursion
Understanding recursive functions and their applications.

### C - argc, argv
Working with command-line arguments in C.

### C - Malloc, free
Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and deallocation with `free`.

### C - More malloc, free
Advanced memory management techniques and error handling.

### C - Structures, typedef
Using structures (`struct`) and typedefs to define custom data types.

### C - Function pointers
Understanding and implementing function pointers in C.

### C - Variadic functions
Handling functions with a variable number of arguments using `stdarg.h`.

### C - Printf (Group Project)
Re-implementing the `printf` function as part of a group project.

### C - Singly linked lists
Understanding and implementing singly linked lists.

### C - Doubly linked lists
Extending linked list concepts to doubly linked lists.

### C - Bit manipulation
Working with bitwise operations for performance and efficiency.

### C - File I/O
Reading and writing files using system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`).

### C - Binary Trees
Exploring binary trees, traversal methods, and their applications.

### C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Implementing and analyzing sorting algorithms with complexity notation (`Big O`).

### C - Simple Shell (Group Project)
Developing a simple UNIX shell as a collaborative project.

## How to Use This Repository
Each directory contains:
- C source files implementing different concepts.
- Header files (`.h`) defining function prototypes.
- Readme files explaining the purpose of each project.
- Compilation instructions and test cases.

### Compilation
All C programs should be compiled with `gcc` using the following flags:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file.c> -o <output>
```

### Coding Style
All code follows the **Betty Coding Style**, ensuring readability and consistency.
