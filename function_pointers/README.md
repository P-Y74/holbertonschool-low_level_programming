# C - Function Pointers

## 📌 Introduction
In this project, you'll dive into one of the most powerful concepts in C: **function pointers**. You will learn how to store, pass, and call functions dynamically through pointers, allowing for flexible and efficient code. Mastering function pointers is essential for advanced C programming, especially in scenarios like callbacks, event-driven programming, and implementing function tables.

## 📚 Resources
Make sure to explore these resources to fully understand function pointers:

- [Function Pointer in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-pointer-in-c/)
- [Pointers to Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_function_pointers.htm)
- [Function Pointers in C / C++](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/function-pointers/)
- [Why Pointers to Functions?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/840501/why-would-you-use-function-pointers-in-c)
- [Everything you need to know about pointers in C](https://boredzo.org/pointers/)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- ✅ What function pointers are and how to use them.
- ✅ What exactly a function pointer holds in memory.
- ✅ Where function pointers point to in virtual memory.

## 📋 Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Compilation on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` at the root of the project folder is **mandatory**.
- Your code must follow **Betty style** — checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global variables are forbidden**.
- No more than **5 functions per file**.
- Only the following C standard library functions are allowed: `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.
  - ❌ Forbidden: `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
  - Do not push `_putchar.c`. We will use our own version during evaluation.
- `main.c` files shown in examples are for **testing only** and should not be pushed.
- All function prototypes, including `_putchar`, must be in a header file named `function_pointers.h`.
- All header files must be **include guarded**.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Declaring and using function pointers.
- Passing functions as parameters.
- Returning function pointers from functions.
- Implementing callbacks and dynamic function calls.
