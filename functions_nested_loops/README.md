# C - Functions, Nested Loops

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on understanding **nested loops**, **functions**, and **header files** in C. It will help you become familiar with how to declare, define, and use functions, along with understanding the scope of variables. You'll also learn how to work with **function prototypes** and **header files** to structure your code effectively.

## 📚 Resources
Read or watch the following materials to understand the key concepts:

- Nested while loops
- C - Functions
- Learning to Program in C (Part 06) *(stop at 14:00)*
- What is a function prototype? *(Read only the “Function prototype paragraph”)*
- What is the purpose of a function prototype?
- C - Header Files *(stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)*

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General
- What **nested loops** are and how to use them.
- What a **function** is and how to use functions.
- The difference between a **declaration** and a **definition** of a function.
- What a **prototype** is.
- The **scope of variables** in C.
- The purpose and use of **header files** with `#include`.
- How to use the **gcc flags**: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
