# C - Functions, Nested Loops

## üìå Introduction
This project focuses on understanding **nested loops**, **functions**, and **header files** in C. It will help you become familiar with how to declare, define, and use functions, along with understanding the scope of variables. You'll also learn how to work with **function prototypes** and **header files** to structure your code effectively.

---

## üìö Resources
Read or watch the following materials to understand the key concepts:

- Nested while loops
- C - Functions
- Learning to Program in C (Part 06) *(stop at 14:00)*
- What is a function prototype? *(Read only the ‚ÄúFunction prototype paragraph‚Äù)*
- What is the purpose of a function prototype?
- C - Header Files *(stop before the ‚ÄúOnce-Only Headers‚Äù paragraph)*

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General
‚úÖ What **nested loops** are and how to use them.
‚úÖ What a **function** is and how to use functions.
‚úÖ The difference between a **declaration** and a **definition** of a function.
‚úÖ What a **prototype** is.
‚úÖ The **scope of variables** in C.
‚úÖ The purpose and use of **header files** with `#include`.
‚úÖ How to use the **gcc flags**: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.

## üìù Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- All files must **end with a new line**.
- Each project directory must contain a `README.md` file.
- No **compilation errors or warnings** are allowed.
- The use of `system()` is **not allowed**.
- Code must follow **Betty Coding Style**.
