# C - Variables, if, else, while

## üìå Introduction
This project introduces the basics of C programming, focusing on **variables**, **conditional statements (if/else)**, and **loops (while)**. You will learn how to declare variables, use arithmetic and logical operators, and control the flow of your program with conditional statements and loops.
