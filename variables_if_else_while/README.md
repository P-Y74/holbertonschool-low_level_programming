# C - Variables, if, else, while

## 📌 Introduction
This project introduces the basics of C programming, focusing on **variables**, **conditional statements (if/else)**, and **loops (while)**. You will learn how to declare variables, use arithmetic and logical operators, and control the flow of your program with conditional statements and loops.

✅ What are the **relational operators** and how to use them.  
✅ What values are considered **TRUE** and **FALSE** in C.  
✅ What are the **boolean operators** and how to use them.  
✅ How to use the **if**, **if ... else** statements.  
✅ How to use **comments**.  
✅ How to declare variables of types **char**, **int**, and **unsigned int**.  
✅ How to assign values to variables.  
✅ How to print the values of variables of type **char**, **int**, and **unsigned int** with **printf**.  
✅ How to use the **while loop**.  
✅ How to use **variables** with the **while loop**.
