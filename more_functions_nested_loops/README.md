# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## üìå Introduction
This project continues to explore the C programming language, with a focus on **functions** and **nested loops**. You will gain more experience with the basic concepts of writing functions, calling functions, and working with loops in C.

---

## üìö Resources
To successfully complete this project, make sure to read and watch the following materials:

- Nested while loops
- C - Functions
- Learning to Program in C (Part 06)
- What is the purpose of a function prototype?
- C - Header Files

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- ‚úÖ What **nested loops** are and how to use them.  
- ‚úÖ What a **function** is and how to use functions.  
- ‚úÖ The difference between a **declaration** and a **definition** of a function.  
- ‚úÖ What a **prototype** is.  
- ‚úÖ The **scope of variables** in C.  
- ‚úÖ The purpose and use of **header files** with `#include`.  
- ‚úÖ How to use the **gcc flags**: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.  

---

## üìã Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```sh
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **Betty style**. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use **global variables**.
- No more than **5 functions per file**.
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
  - You don‚Äôt have to push `_putchar.c`; we will use our file. If you do, it won‚Äôt be taken into account.
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you **don‚Äôt have to push them** to your repo (if you do, we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files during compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
- Don‚Äôt forget to push your **header file**.

### More Info

- You do not have to understand **call by reference (address)**, **stack**, **static variables**, **recursions**, or **arrays** yet.
